# Faisal's Modifications:
- I fixed bugs related to running the code. The code run now without any errors.
- I updated the tansorflow code to run with the new version of tensorflow.

## The requirements are:
- Python 3.11 (Maybe older versions work too)
- tensorflow 2.16.1
- scikit-learn 1.4.2
- scipy 1.13.0
- numpy 1.26.4

## How to run the code
```bash
python main.py
```
